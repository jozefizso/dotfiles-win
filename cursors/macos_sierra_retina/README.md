## Notes

Dec 13, 2016 — Bugfixes. Now it's much better.  
Dec 12, 2016 — First release

The world's best macOS Sierra pointers port for 150% and 175% Windows DPI.
A lot of hard work to do them in hight quality — some pointers have been adapted especially for limited format of Windows.

Thanks :iconjelbo: for request and great support!

### How to enjoy

1. Make sure that your Windows DPI is **150%** or **175%**
2. Right click `Install.inf` and click **«Install»**
3. Go to **Control Panel** → **Mouse** and choose **«macOS Sierra, Retina-pointers»** scheme.
