## Notes

Dec 13, 2016 — Bugfixes. Now it's much better.  
Dec 12, 2016 — First release

The world's best macOS Sierra pointers port for 150% and 175% Windows DPI.
A lot of hard work to do them in hight quality — some pointers have been adapted especially for limited format of Windows.

Thanks [iconjelbo](https://www.deviantart.com/jelbo) for request and great support!
